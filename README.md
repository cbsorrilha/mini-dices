## Welcome to Mini Dices ðŸŽ²

This repository will keep files to teach programming using a hands-on methodology.

### How is it going to work?

You will create an application that rolls RPG dices, like d3, d6, d10, d20, and d100, and save its results to the browser.
For those unfamiliar with RPG dices, they have multiple faces, unlike a regular 6 faces dice. A d20, for example, has 20 faces, numbered from 1 to 20.
